# Movie Collection App

## Technologies Used
This application was built using React and Firebase. 

## Demo
I deployed the app to https://pwamsley2015.github.io/movie for an easy demo. 

## Run locally
To run locally, first clone this repo. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwamsley2015/stepstone_global_assessment.git
```

Navigate to the movie_log directory.
```bash
cd stepstone_global_assessment/movie_log
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

and then simply start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app is now running on localhost:3000.
